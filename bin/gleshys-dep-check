# Lazy start version just assures my versions. Fairly sure any bash 4+ will do.
# curl is probably like "any version. at all. period. hard stop."
# jq might be harder, haven't done any magic really yet.

# I am using grep here. Check version for that too? =)

# TODO
# Check if the tools are available before executing?
# Some verbose mode?
# Possible to skip checking via settings flag.
# Store timestamp for last check in ~/.config/gleshys.cfg or such
# And then read that to asses if we need to check compat again... once
#   per 24h is a good floor probably
